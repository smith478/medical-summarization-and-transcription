    " the lesion occupied the left hemithorax although the most common localisation reported in the literature is the lower and right oesophagus . \n",
    " the presentation depends on the site and the size of the malformations , varying from dysphagia and respiratory distress to a lump and perforation or bleeding into the intestine , but cysts are mostly diagnosed incidentally . \n",
